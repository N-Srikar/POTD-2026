Find H-Index
You are given an array citations[], where each element citations[i] represents the number of citations received by the ith paper of a researcher. You have to calculate the researcher’s H-index.
The H-index is defined as the maximum value H, such that the researcher has published at least H papers, and all those papers have citation value greater than or equal to H.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        Arrays.sort(citations);
        int n = citations.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int h = n - i;
            if (citations[i] >= h) {
                return h;
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
}

Intuition :
The H-index is the largest number H such that:
There are at least H papers
Each of those H papers has at least H citations

So we are looking for the maximum H where:
number of papers with citations ≥ H ≥ 𝐻

Sorting helps because once citations are in order, we can easily count how many papers meet the condition for each possible H.

Approach :
Sort the citations array in ascending order.
Let n be the number of papers.

Traverse the sorted array:
For each index i, compute: h = n - i (number of papers from index i to end)
If citations[i] >= h, then h is a valid H-index.
Return the first such h encountered.

If no such value found, return 0.
