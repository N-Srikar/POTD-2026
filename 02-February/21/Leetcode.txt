762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation
Given two integers left and right, return the count of numbers in the inclusive range [left, right] having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.
Recall that the number of set bits an integer has is the number of 1's present when written in binary.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int countPrimeSetBits(int left, int right) {
        int count=0;
        
        for (int i=left;i<=right;i++) {
            int setBits=Integer.bitCount(i);
            if (isPrime(setBits)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n<=1) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i=2;i*i <= n;i++) {
            if (n%i==0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}

Intuition :
For every number in the range [left, right], we need to:
Count how many 1s appear in its binary representation (number of set bits).
Check whether that count is a prime number.
So the problem reduces to filtering numbers based on whether the count of their set bits is prime.

Since the maximum number of bits in an integer is small (at most 32), the number of possible set bits is also small, making the prime check efficient.

Approach :
Initialize a counter count = 0.
Iterate from left to right (inclusive).

For each number:
Use Integer.bitCount(i) to count the number of set bits.
Check whether this count is prime using a helper function.

If prime, increment the counter.
Return the final count.

The isPrime(n) function:
Return false if n <= 1.
Check divisibility from 2 to √n.
If divisible → not prime.
Otherwise → prime.

Complexity :
Time complexity: O((right - left + 1) × √m)
Space complexity: O(1)
