The Painter's Partition Problem-II
Given an array arr[] where each element denotes the length of a board, and an integer k representing the number of painters available. Each painter takes 1 unit of time to paint 1 unit length of a board.

Determine the minimum amount of time required to paint all the boards, under the constraint that each painter can paint only a contiguous sequence of boards (no skipping or splitting allowed).

Code :
class Solution {
    public int minTime(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;

        int low = 0, high = 0;
        for (int x : arr) {
            low = Math.max(low, x);
            high += x;
        }

        int ans = high;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;

            if (canPaint(arr, k, mid)) {
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

    private boolean canPaint(int[] arr, int k, int maxTime) {
        int painters = 1;
        int currSum = 0;

        for (int length : arr) {
            if (currSum + length > maxTime) {
                painters++;
                currSum = length;
                if (painters > k) return false;
            } else {
                currSum += length;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}

Intuition :
Each painter must paint a contiguous block of boards, and we want to minimize the maximum time taken by any painter.

If we assume a time limit T:
We can check whether it is possible to assign boards to at most k painters such that no painter paints more than T units.

Important observation:
If time T is feasible, then any time > T is also feasible.
If time T is not feasible, any time < T is also not feasible.

This monotonic property makes the problem suitable for binary search on answer.

Approach :
Step 1: Define Search Space
low = max(arr)
(Minimum possible time must be at least the largest board length.)
high = sum(arr)
(Maximum time if only one painter paints everything.)

Step 2: Binary Search
For a candidate time mid:
Start assigning boards to painters sequentially.
Keep accumulating board lengths for the current painter.
If adding a board exceeds mid, assign a new painter.
Count how many painters are needed.
If painters needed ≤ k, then mid is feasible.
Otherwise, increase time.

Time Complexity: O(n log(sum(arr)))
Space Complexity: O(1)
