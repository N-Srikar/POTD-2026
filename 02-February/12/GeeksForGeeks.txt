Max min Height
Given a garden with n flowers planted in a row, that is represented by an array arr[], where arr[i] denotes the height of the ith flower.You will water them for k days. In one day you can water w continuous flowers. Whenever you water a flower its height increases by 1 unit. You have to maximize the minimum height of all flowers after  k days of watering.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int maxMinHeight(int[] arr, int k, int w) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int low = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int x : arr) low = Math.min(low, x);
        int high = low + k;
        int ans = low;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (canAchieve(arr, k, w, mid)) {
                ans = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }

    private boolean canAchieve(int[] arr, int k, int w, int target) {
        int n = arr.length;
        long[] diff = new long[n + 1];
        long currAdd = 0;
        long used = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            currAdd += diff[i];
            long currentHeight = arr[i] + currAdd;

            if (currentHeight < target) {
                long need = target - currentHeight;
                used += need;
                if (used > k) return false;

                currAdd += need;
                if (i + w < n) {
                    diff[i + w] -= need;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}

Intuition :
We want to maximize the minimum height after performing watering operations.
Each watering operation:
Increases height of w consecutive flowers by 1
We can perform at most k operations

If we fix a target minimum height H, the question becomes:
Can we make every flower's height at least H using at most k operations?

This is a classic binary search on answer problem because:
If we can achieve height H, then we can also achieve any height < H
If we cannot achieve H, then we cannot achieve anything larger

This monotonic property allows binary search.
To efficiently simulate watering, we use a difference array technique to apply range increments in O(1).

Approach :
Step 1: Binary Search on Target Height
low = minimum value in arr
high = minimum value + k
Binary search on possible minimum height.

Step 2: Check Function (Greedy + Difference Array)
To check if we can achieve height mid:
Maintain:
extra[] → difference array
currAdd → cumulative increment at position i
used → operations used so far

Traverse from left to right:
Apply cumulative additions.
If arr[i] + currAdd < mid:
Compute need = mid - (arr[i] + currAdd)
Increase operations used by need
If used > k, return false
Apply range increment using difference array for next w elements.

If traversal completes within k, return true.
