1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced
You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.

You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int minimumDeletions(String s) {
        int res = 0, count = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()){
            if (c == 'b')
                count++;
            else if (count != 0){
                res++;
                count--;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}

Intuition :
Instead of directly thinking about which elements to remove, it is easier to think about which elements to keep. A balanced array must satisfy max ≤ min × k. After sorting the array, any valid balanced subset will appear as a contiguous subarray, because the minimum and maximum of the subset are simply its first and last elements. Therefore, the goal becomes finding the longest subarray where this condition holds, and removing all other elements.

Approach :
Sort the array in ascending order.
Use a sliding window with two pointers i (left) and j (right).
For each j, treat nums[j] as the current maximum.
While the condition nums[j] > nums[i] × k is violated, increment i to shrink the window.
Track the maximum window length j − i + 1 that satisfies the condition.
The minimum number of removals is n − maxLen, where n is the array length.
