Equalize the Towers
You are given an array heights[] representing the heights of towers and another array cost[] where each element represents the cost of modifying the height of respective tower.

The goal is to make all towers of same height by either adding or removing blocks from each tower.
Modifying the height of tower 'i' by 1 unit (add or remove) costs cost[i].

Return the minimum cost to equalize the heights of all the towers.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] heights, int[] cost) {
        int n = heights.length;

        int[][] towers = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            towers[i][0] = heights[i];
            towers[i][1] = cost[i];
        }

        Arrays.sort(towers, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        long totalWeight = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalWeight += towers[i][1];
        }

        long cumulative = 0;
        int median = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cumulative += towers[i][1];
            if (cumulative * 2 >= totalWeight) {
                median = towers[i][0];
                break;
            }
        }

        long totalCost = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalCost += (long)Math.abs(towers[i][0] - median) * towers[i][1];
        }

        return (int) totalCost;
    }
}

Intuition :
We want to make all towers equal to some height H.
If we choose a target height H, the total cost becomes: Total Cost(H)=∑ ∣ heights[i]−H ∣ × cost[i]

This is a weighted absolute difference minimization problem.

A key mathematical fact:
The value of H that minimizes the weighted sum of absolute differences is the weighted median of the heights.

So instead of trying all possible heights, we:
Sort towers by height.
Find the weighted median.
Compute total cost using that height.

This gives the minimum cost.

Approach :
Create pairs (height, cost).
Sort them by height.
Compute total cost sum.

Find the weighted median:
Traverse sorted towers.
Keep accumulating costs.
The height where cumulative cost ≥ totalCost/2 is the weighted median.

Compute total cost using: sum += abs(height[i] - median) * cost[i]

Return the total cost.
