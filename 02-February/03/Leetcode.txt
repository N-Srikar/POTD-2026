3637. Trionic Array I
You are given an integer array nums of length n.

An array is trionic if there exist indices 0 < p < q < n − 1 such that:
nums[0...p] is strictly increasing,
nums[p...q] is strictly decreasing,
nums[q...n − 1] is strictly increasing.
Return true if nums is trionic, otherwise return false.

Code :
class Solution {
    public boolean isTrionic(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int i = 1;
        while (i < n && nums[i - 1] < nums[i]) {
            i++;
        }
        int p = i - 1;
        while (i < n && nums[i - 1] > nums[i]) {
            i++;
        }
        int q = i - 1;
        while (i < n && nums[i - 1] < nums[i]) {
            i++;
        }
        int flag = i - 1;
        return (p != 0) && (q != p) && (flag == n - 1 && flag != q);
    }
}

Intuition :
A trionic array has a very specific shape: it must increase strictly, then decrease strictly, and finally increase strictly again. Since these segments are contiguous and must appear in this exact order, we can detect the pattern with a single left-to-right scan. By advancing pointers while the required monotonic condition holds, we can identify the boundaries of each segment and then validate that all three segments are non-empty and correctly ordered.

Approach :
Start scanning from index 1 and move forward while the array is strictly increasing.
Mark the end of this first increasing segment as p.
Continue scanning while the array is strictly decreasing.
Mark the end of the decreasing segment as q.
Continue scanning while the array is strictly increasing again.

Finally, check the validity conditions:
The first increasing segment must contain at least one element (p ≠ 0).
The decreasing segment must be non-empty (q ≠ p).
The last increasing segment must be non-empty and must reach the end of the array (flag = n − 1 and flag ≠ q).

Return true if all conditions are satisfied; otherwise return false.
