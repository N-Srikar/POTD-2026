Stock Buy and Sell – Max one Transaction Allowed
Given an array prices[] of non-negative integers, representing the prices of the stocks on different days. The task is to find the maximum profit possible by buying and selling the stocks on different days when at most one transaction is allowed. Here one transaction means 1 buy + 1 Sell. If it is not possible to make a profit then return 0.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int minPrice = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxProfit = 0;

        for (int price : prices) {
            if (price < minPrice) {
                minPrice = price;
            } else {
                maxProfit = Math.max(maxProfit, price - minPrice);
            }
        }

        return maxProfit;
    }
}

Intuition :
With at most one transaction (one buy followed by one sell), the goal is to buy at the lowest possible price and sell later at the highest possible price to maximize profit.

Instead of checking all pairs of days (which would be inefficient), we can:
Keep track of the minimum price seen so far while scanning the array.
At each day, calculate the profit if we sell on that day.
Maintain the maximum profit obtained so far.

If prices only decrease, no profitable transaction is possible, so the answer should be 0.

Approach :
Initialize:
minPrice as a very large value.
maxProfit as 0.

Traverse the prices array:
Update minPrice if the current price is lower.
Otherwise, compute profit = currentPrice - minPrice.
Update maxProfit if this profit is higher.

After traversal, return maxProfit.
