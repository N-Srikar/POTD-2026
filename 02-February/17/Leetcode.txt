401. Binary Watch
A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top to represent the hours (0-11), and 6 LEDs on the bottom to represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

Given an integer turnedOn which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on (ignoring the PM), return all possible times the watch could represent. You may return the answer in any order.

The hour must not contain a leading zero.

For example, "01:00" is not valid. It should be "1:00".
The minute must consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero.

For example, "10:2" is not valid. It should be "10:02".

Code :
class Solution {
    public List<String> readBinaryWatch(int turnedOn) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int hour = 0; hour < 12; hour++) {
            
            for (int minute = 0; minute < 60; minute++) {
                
                int totalBits = Integer.bitCount(hour) + Integer.bitCount(minute);
                
                if (totalBits == turnedOn) {
                    
                    String time = hour + ":" + 
                                  (minute < 10 ? "0" + minute : minute);
                    
                    result.add(time);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}

Intuition :
A binary watch represents hours (0–11) using 4 LEDs and minutes (0–59) using 6 LEDs.
Each LED corresponds to a bit in the binary representation.

Instead of manually generating LED combinations, we can simply iterate through all valid hour and minute values and count their set bits.
______________________________________________________

Approach :
Iterate hour from 0 to 11.
Iterate minute from 0 to 59.

For each pair:
Compute:
Integer.bitCount(hour) + Integer.bitCount(minute)
If the total equals turnedOn, add the formatted time to the result list.

Formatting rules:
Hour should not have leading zeros.
Minute must always have two digits (add leading zero if needed).
Return the list of all valid times.
