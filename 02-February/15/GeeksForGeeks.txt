Chocolate Distribution Problem
Given an array arr[] of positive integers, where each value represents the number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets among m students such that
-> Each student gets exactly one packet.
-> The difference between maximum number of chocolates given to a student and minimum number of chocolates given to a student is minimum and return that minimum possible difference.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int findMinDiff(ArrayList<Integer> arr, int m) {
        if (m == 0 || arr.size() < m) return 0;

        Collections.sort(arr);
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i + m - 1 < arr.size(); i++) {
            int diff = arr.get(i + m - 1) - arr.get(i);
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, diff);
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
}

Intuition :
We must distribute exactly m packets (one per student) such that:
(maximum chocolates) − (minimum chocolates) is minimized.

Since each student gets exactly one packet, the problem reduces to:
Choose m packets such that the difference between the largest and smallest packet in that selection is minimum.

If we sort the packets:
Any optimal selection of m packets will form a contiguous subarray.
Because skipping values would only increase the difference.

So after sorting, we just need to check all windows of size m.

Approach :
If m == 0 or arr.size() < m, return 0.
Sort the array.
Initialize minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE.

Traverse from i = 0 to n - m:
Compute: diff = arr.get(i + m - 1) - arr.get(i)
Update minDiff.

Return minDiff.
