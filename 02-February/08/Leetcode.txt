110. Balanced Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
________________________________________________________

Code :
class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        return checkHeight(root) != -1;
    }

    private int checkHeight(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        int leftHeight = checkHeight(node.left);
        if (leftHeight == -1) return -1;

        int rightHeight = checkHeight(node.right);
        if (rightHeight == -1) return -1;

        if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) return -1;

        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
}

Intuition
A binary tree is height-balanced if, for every node, the heights of its left and right subtrees differ by at most one. A naive solution would compute heights separately for each node, leading to repeated work. To optimize this, we can combine height computation and balance checking in a single depth-first traversal. By propagating an error signal upward as soon as an imbalance is detected, we avoid unnecessary calculations.

Approach :
Use a recursive DFS helper function that returns:
The height of the subtree if it is balanced.
-1 if the subtree is unbalanced.

Recursively compute the height of the left subtree:
If it returns -1, the subtree is unbalanced, so propagate -1.

Recursively compute the height of the right subtree:
If it returns -1, propagate -1.

Check the height difference between left and right subtrees:
If the difference exceeds 1, return -1.

Otherwise, return 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight).
The tree is balanced if the final result is not -1.
