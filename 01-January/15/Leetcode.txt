2943. Maximize Area of Square Hole in Grid
You are given the two integers, n and m and two integer arrays, hBars and vBars. The grid has n + 2 horizontal and m + 2 vertical bars, creating 1 x 1 unit cells. The bars are indexed starting from 1.

You can remove some of the bars in hBars from horizontal bars and some of the bars in vBars from vertical bars. Note that other bars are fixed and cannot be removed.

Return an integer denoting the maximum area of a square-shaped hole in the grid, after removing some bars (possibly none).

class Solution {
    public int maximizeSquareHoleArea(int n, int m, int[] hBars, int[] vBars) {
        int gap = Math.min(getMaxGap(hBars), getMaxGap(vBars));
        return gap * gap;
    }
    
    public int getMaxGap(int[] bars){
        Arrays.sort(bars);
        int count = 2, res = 2;
        for(int i = 1; i < bars.length; ++i){
            count = (bars[i-1] + 1 == bars[i])? count + 1: 2;
            res = Math.max(res, count);
        }
        return res;
    }
}

Intuition
We remove a bar means its add the squar of prev and next line/vertical.
When we remove n consecutive bars then the size of the connected small squar width/height becom n+1.
So we need to check for max continuos bars length we can remove from horizontal and max consecutive bars we can remove from vertical.

Approach :
Sort the vBar and hBar
Check the max gap in horizontal and max gap in vertical
Take min of the (max horizontal gap , max vertical gap) and return its square as answer.
