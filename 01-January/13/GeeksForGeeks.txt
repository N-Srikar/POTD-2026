Bus Ticket Change
You are given an array arr[] representing passengers in a queue. Each bus ticket costs 5 coins, and arr[i] denotes the note a passenger uses to pay (which can be 5, 10, or 20). You must serve the passengers in the given order and always provide the correct change so that each passenger effectively pays exactly 5 coins. 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to serve all passengers in the queue without ever running out of change.

Code :
class Solution {
    public boolean canServe(int[] arr) {
        int five = 0, ten = 0;

        for (int bill : arr) {
            if (bill == 5) {
                five++;
            } 
            else if (bill == 10) {
                if (five == 0) return false;
                five--;
                ten++;
            } 
            else {
                if (ten > 0 && five > 0) {
                    ten--;
                    five--;
                } 
                else if (five >= 3) {
                    five -= 3;
                } 
                else {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

Intuition :
Each ticket costs 5 coins, and passengers pay using notes of 5, 10, or 20.
You must always give exact change immediately, and passengers must be served in order.

The key idea is to track how many 5-coin and 10-coin notes you currently have, because:
A 5 coin requires no change.
A 10 coin requires one 5 as change.
A 20 coin requires either one 10 + one 5, or three 5s.

If at any point you cannot provide the required change, serving all passengers becomes impossible.

Approach :
Maintain two counters:
five → number of 5-coin notes available
ten → number of 10-coin notes available

Traverse the array arr in order:
If the passenger pays with 5:
Increment five

If the passenger pays with 10:
You must give one 5 as change
Decrement five, increment ten

If the passenger pays with 20:
Prefer giving one 10 and one 5 as change (to preserve smaller coins)
Otherwise, give three 5s
If neither is possible, return false

If all passengers are processed successfully, return true.
