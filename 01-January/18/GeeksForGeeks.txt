Next element with greater frequency
Given an array arr[] of integers, for each element, find the first element to its right that has a higher frequency than the current element.
If no such element exists, return -1 for that position.

Code :
class Solution {
    public ArrayList<Integer> nextFreqGreater(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        ArrayList<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) result.add(-1);

        HashMap<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (int x : arr) {
            freq.put(x, freq.getOrDefault(x, 0) + 1);
        }

        Stack<Integer> st = new Stack<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (!st.isEmpty() &&
                   freq.get(arr[i]) > freq.get(arr[st.peek()])) {
                result.set(st.pop(), arr[i]);
            }
            st.push(i);
        }

        return result;
    }
}

Intuition :
For each element, we are not comparing values directly; instead, we compare their frequencies in the entire array.
The task is to find the next element to the right whose frequency is strictly greater than the frequency of the current element.

This is similar in structure to the Next Greater Element problem, but the comparison key is frequency, not value.
To solve this efficiently, we:
Precompute frequencies of all elements.
Use a monotonic stack to find the next element with a higher frequency.

Approach :
Compute the frequency of each element using a HashMap.

Initialize:
A stack to store indices.
An answer list initialized with -1 for all positions.

Traverse the array from left to right:
While the stack is not empty and
frequency(arr[current]) > frequency(arr[stackTop]):
Set the answer for stackTop as arr[current].
Pop the stack.
Push the current index onto the stack.

Elements left in the stack do not have any element to their right with higher frequency, so their answer remains -1.
Return the result list.
