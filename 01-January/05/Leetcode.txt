1975. Maximum Matrix Sum
You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:

Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.
Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.

Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. 
Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

Code :
class Solution {
    public long maxMatrixSum(int[][] m) {
        int count=0; 
        int n=m.length;
        int min=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        long sum=0;
        for(int i=0 ; i<n ; i++){
            for(int j=0 ; j<n ; j++){
                if(m[i][j]<0){
                    count++;
                }
                if(Math.abs(m[i][j])<min) min = Math.abs(m[i][j]);
                sum+=Math.abs(m[i][j]);
            }
        }
        count=count%2;
        if(count==0)return sum;
        else return sum-2*min;
    }
}

Intuition :
The operation allows flipping the signs of two adjacent cells at the same time. This means the parity (even or odd) of negative elements in the matrix is invariant unless a zero is involved. To maximize the matrix sum, we want as many positive values as possible. Therefore, taking the absolute value of every element gives the largest possible contribution, except when an odd number of negative values exists. In that case, one element must remain negative, and to minimize the loss, it should be the element with the smallest absolute value.

Approach :
Traverse the matrix and compute the sum of absolute values of all elements.
Count how many elements are negative.
Track the minimum absolute value in the entire matrix.
If the count of negative elements is even, all values can effectively be made positive, so return the absolute sum.
If the count of negative elements is odd, subtract 2 × (minimum absolute value) from the sum to account for one unavoidable negative value.
Return the resulting maximum sum.
