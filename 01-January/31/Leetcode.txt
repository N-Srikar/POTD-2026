744. Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target
You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.

Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

Code :
class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int low=0, high=letters.length -1;
        int mid;
        int pos=-1;
        while(low<=high)
        {
            mid = (low+high)/2;
            if(letters[mid]>target)
            {
                pos=mid;
                high = mid-1;
            }
            else
            {
                low=mid+1;
            }
        }
      return pos == -1 ? letters[0] : letters[pos];

    }
}

Intuition
The letters array is already sorted, so the smallest character that is strictly greater than the target must appear at or after the first position where a character exceeds the target. If all characters are less than or equal to the target, the answer wraps around and becomes the first character in the array. This wrap-around behavior makes binary search an ideal approach.

Approach :
Use binary search on the sorted letters array.
Maintain a variable to store the position of the smallest character found so far that is greater than the target.

If the middle character is greater than the target:
Record its position.
Continue searching the left half to find a smaller valid character.

If the middle character is less than or equal to the target:
Search the right half.

After the search:
If a valid position was found, return that character.
Otherwise, return the first character in the array.
