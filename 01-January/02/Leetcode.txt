961. N-Repeated Element in Size 2N Array
You are given an integer array nums with the following properties:
nums.length == 2 * n.
nums contains n + 1 unique elements.
Exactly one element of nums is repeated n times.

Return the element that is repeated n times.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int repeatedNTimes(int[] A) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for(int num:A) {
            if(set.contains(num)) return num;
            else set.add(num);
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
_______________________________________________________

Intuition :
The array contains exactly one element that appears multiple times, while all other elements are unique. If we scan the array and keep track of elements we have already seen, the first element that appears again must be the one repeated n times, because no other element is allowed to repeat.
_______________________________________________________

Approach :
Initialize an empty HashSet to store elements encountered so far.
Traverse the array element by element.
For each element:
If it already exists in the set, return it immediately as the repeated element.
Otherwise, add it to the set.
Since the problem guarantees a valid repeated element, the loop will always return before completion.
