Flattening a Linked List
Given a linked list containing n head nodes where every node in the linked list contains two pointers:
(i) next points to the next node in the list.
(ii) bottom points to a sub-linked list where the current node is the head.
Each of the sub-linked lists nodes and the head nodes are sorted in ascending order based on their data. Flatten the linked list such that all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted order.

Note:
1. ↓ represents the bottom pointer and → represents the next pointer.
2. The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of the next pointer.

Code :
class Solution {
    public Node flatten(Node root) {
        if (root == null || root.next == null) {
            return root;
        }

        root.next = flatten(root.next);
        root = merge(root, root.next);
        return root;
    }

    private Node merge(Node a, Node b) {
        if (a == null) return b;
        if (b == null) return a;

        Node result;
        if (a.data < b.data) {
            result = a;
            result.bottom = merge(a.bottom, b);
        } else {
            result = b;
            result.bottom = merge(a, b.bottom);
        }

        result.next = null;
        return result;
    }
}

Intuition :
Each node in the linked list represents the head of a sorted sub-linked list (via the bottom pointer), and the main list formed by next pointers is also sorted.
The problem is essentially about merging multiple sorted linked lists into one sorted list.

Instead of flattening everything at once, we can flatten the list step by step by merging:
the current list, and
the already flattened version of the rest of the list.

This is very similar to how merge sort works on linked lists.

Approach :
Base Case
If the list is empty or there is only one head node, return it as it is.

Recursive Flattening
Recursively flatten the list starting from root.next.

Merge Two Sorted Lists
Merge the current node’s bottom list with the flattened list obtained from the right.
The merge is done using the bottom pointer only.
Ensure next pointers are ignored (set to null).

Return the merged list, which remains sorted and uses only bottom pointers.
