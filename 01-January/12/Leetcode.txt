1266. Minimum Time Visiting All Points
On a 2D plane, there are n points with integer coordinates points[i] = [xi, yi]. Return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by points.

You can move according to these rules:
In 1 second, you can either:
move vertically by one unit,
move horizontally by one unit, or
move diagonally sqrt(2) units (in other words, move one unit vertically then one unit horizontally in 1 second).

You have to visit the points in the same order as they appear in the array.
You are allowed to pass through points that appear later in the order, but these do not count as visits.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int minTimeToVisitAllPoints(int[][] points) {
        int time = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length-1; i++) {
            int x = points[i][0];
            int y = points[i][1];
            
            int a = points[i+1][0];
            int b = points[i+1][1];
            
            time += Math.max(Math.abs(a - x), Math.abs(b - y));
        }
        
        return time;
    }
}

Intuition :
To move from one point to the next, we want to minimize the total time by taking advantage of diagonal moves whenever possible. A diagonal move reduces both the horizontal and vertical distance simultaneously in one second. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to move diagonally for as long as both the x and y coordinates differ, and then move straight in the remaining direction. This results in the minimum time needed between two points.

Approach :
Iterate through the points in the given order.

For each consecutive pair of points:
Compute the absolute difference in x-coordinates.
Compute the absolute difference in y-coordinates.

The minimum time to move between two points is the maximum of these two differences, since diagonal moves can cover one unit in both directions per second.

Add this value to the total time.

After processing all point pairs, return the total time.
