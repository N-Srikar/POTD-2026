Substrings with K Distinct
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase characters and an integer k, You have to count all possible substrings that have exactly k distinct characters.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int countSubstr(String s, int k) {
        return atMost(s, k) - atMost(s, k - 1);
    }

    private int atMost(String s, int k) {
        int left = 0, count = 0;
        int[] freq = new int[26];

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            if (freq[s.charAt(right) - 'a']++ == 0) {
                k--;
            }

            while (k < 0) {
                if (--freq[s.charAt(left) - 'a'] == 0) {
                    k++;
                }
                left++;
            }

            count += right - left + 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}

Intuition :
The problem requires counting substrings with exactly k distinct characters.
Directly counting such substrings is difficult, but we can simplify the task using an important observation:

Substrings with exactly k distinct characters
= Substrings with at most k distinct characters − Substrings with at most k - 1 distinct characters

This allows us to reduce the problem to counting substrings with at most k distinct characters, which can be efficiently solved using a sliding window.
_______________________________________________________

Approach :
Define a helper function atMost(k) that counts substrings with at most k distinct characters.

In atMost(k):
Use a sliding window with two pointers left and right.
Maintain a frequency map of characters in the current window.
Expand the window by moving right.
If the number of distinct characters exceeds k, shrink the window from the left until it becomes valid.
At each step, add right - left + 1 to the count (all valid substrings ending at right).

Compute:
atMost(k) - atMost(k - 1)

Return the result.
