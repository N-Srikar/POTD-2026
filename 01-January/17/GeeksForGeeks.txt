Expression contains redundant bracket or not
Given a string of balanced expression s, check if it contains a redundant parenthesis or not. A set of parenthesis are redundant if the same sub-expression is surrounded by unnecessary or multiple brackets.
Note: Expression may contain + , - , *, and / operators. Given expression is valid and there are no white spaces present.

Code :
class Solution {
    public static boolean checkRedundancy(String s) {
        Stack<Character> st = new Stack<>();

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch != ')') {
                st.push(ch);
            } else {
                boolean hasOperator = false;

                while (!st.isEmpty() && st.peek() != '(') {
                    char top = st.pop();
                    if (top == '+' || top == '-' || top == '*' || top == '/') {
                        hasOperator = true;
                    }
                }

                st.pop(); // remove '('

                if (!hasOperator) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

Intuition :
Redundant brackets are those parentheses that do not contribute to changing the meaning of the expression.
In a valid arithmetic expression, a pair of brackets is useful only if there is at least one operator inside them.

So, if we encounter a closing bracket ) and inside the matching opening bracket ( there is no operator, then those brackets are redundant.

Using a stack helps us examine the contents inside each pair of parentheses efficiently.

Approach :
Initialize an empty stack of characters.

Traverse the expression character by character:
If the current character is not a closing bracket ), push it onto the stack.

When a closing bracket ) is encountered:
Pop elements from the stack until an opening bracket ( is found.
While popping, check if any operator (+, -, *, /) exists.
If no operator is found before encountering (, the brackets are redundant → return true.
Pop the opening bracket (.

If the entire expression is processed without finding redundant brackets, return false.
