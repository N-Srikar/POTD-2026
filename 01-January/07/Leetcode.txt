1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized.

Return the maximum product of the sums of the two subtrees. 
Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note that you need to maximize the answer before taking the mod and not after taking it.

Code :
class Solution {
    long MOD = 1000000007L;
    long ans = 0;

    private long dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;

        node.val += dfs(node.left) + dfs(node.right);
        return node.val;
    }

    public int maxProduct(TreeNode root) {
        long total = dfs(root);

        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
        q.add(root);

        while (!q.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode node = q.poll();
            if (node == null) continue;

            long cur = (total - node.val) * node.val;
            ans = Math.max(ans, cur);

            if (node.left != null) q.add(node.left);
            if (node.right != null) q.add(node.right);
        }

        return (int)(ans % MOD);
    }
}

Intuition :
Removing one edge splits the binary tree into two subtrees. If the total sum of the tree is S and the sum of one subtree is s, then the product obtained by removing the connecting edge is s × (S − s). Therefore, the problem reduces to finding a subtree whose sum is as close as possible to S / 2, since for a fixed total sum the product s(S − s) is maximized near this value. If we know the sum of every subtree, we can evaluate this product for every possible split and choose the maximum.

Approach :
Perform a DFS traversal to compute the sum of each subtree.
For every node, calculate the sum of its left and right subtrees and add it to the node’s value.
After DFS completes, the value at the root represents the total sum of the tree.

Traverse the tree again (using BFS or DFS).
For each node, consider removing the edge above it.
Compute the product: node.val × (totalSum − node.val).
Keep track of the maximum product encountered.

After evaluating all possible splits, return the maximum product modulo (10^9 + 7).
The modulo is applied only at the end to avoid affecting the maximization.
