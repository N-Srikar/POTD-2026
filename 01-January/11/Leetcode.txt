85. Maximal Rectangle
Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int maximalRectangle(char[][] matrix) {
        if (matrix == null || matrix.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        int[] heights = new int[n + 1];
        int maxArea = 0;
        
        for (char[] row : matrix) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                heights[i] = row[i] == '1' ? heights[i] + 1 : 0;
            }
            
            Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
            stack.push(-1);
            for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
                while (stack.peek() != -1 && heights[i] < heights[stack.peek()]) {
                    int h = heights[stack.pop()];
                    int w = i - stack.peek() - 1;
                    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, h * w);
                }
                stack.push(i);
            }
        }
        
        return maxArea;        
    }
}

Intuition :
The problem can be reduced to repeatedly solving the Largest Rectangle in Histogram problem. Each row of the matrix is treated as the base of a histogram, where the height of each column represents the number of consecutive '1's seen vertically up to that row. By updating these heights row by row and computing the largest rectangle area for each histogram, we can find the maximum rectangle consisting entirely of '1's in the matrix.

Approach :
If the matrix is empty, return 0.
Determine the number of columns n and initialize an array heights of size n + 1 with all values set to 0.
Initialize a variable maxArea to store the maximum rectangle area.

For each row in the matrix:
Update the heights array:
If the current cell is '1', increment the corresponding height.
Otherwise, reset the height to 0.

Use a monotonic increasing stack to compute the largest rectangle area in the current histogram:
Push -1 as a sentinel index.
Traverse through the heights array.

While the current height is smaller than the height at the stack’s top index:
Pop the stack and calculate the rectangle area using the popped height.
Update maxArea if a larger area is found.
Push the current index onto the stack.

After processing all rows, return maxArea.
