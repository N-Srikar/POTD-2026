3315. Construct the Minimum Bitwise Array II
You are given an array nums consisting of n prime integers.

You need to construct an array ans of length n, such that, for each index i, the bitwise OR of ans[i] and ans[i] + 1 is equal to nums[i], i.e. ans[i] OR (ans[i] + 1) == nums[i].

Additionally, you must minimize each value of ans[i] in the resulting array.

If it is not possible to find such a value for ans[i] that satisfies the condition, then set ans[i] = -1.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int[] minBitwiseArray(List<Integer> A) {
        int n = A.size(), res[] = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int a = A.get(i);
            if (A.get(i) % 2 == 0) {
                res[i] = -1;
            } else {
                res[i] = a - ((a + 1) & (-a - 1)) / 2;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}

Intuition
We are given the condition
ans[i] OR (ans[i] + 1) = nums[i]
and we want to minimize ans[i].

A crucial observation is that x OR (x + 1) is always odd, because x + 1 flips the least significant bit to 1. Therefore, if nums[i] is even, it is impossible to satisfy the condition and the answer must be -1.

When nums[i] is odd, a valid solution exists. In binary form, the operation x OR (x + 1) works by flipping the rightmost 0 bit of x to 1 while keeping higher bits unchanged. To minimize x, we must undo this effect by locating that bit and clearing it. This can be done efficiently using bit manipulation tricks.

Approach :
Iterate through each number a in the array.
If a is even, set the corresponding result to -1.
If a is odd:
Use bit manipulation to locate the leftmost bit in the trailing sequence of ones.
Subtract the appropriate value from a to clear that bit and obtain the minimum valid ans[i].

Store the computed value in the result array.
Return the result array.
