Implement UNDO & REDO
You are given a text document that is initially empty. You need to complete the following functions:
void append(char x) - Append the character x to the end of the document.
void undo() - Undo the most recent APPEND operation (remove the last appended character).
void redo() - Reapply the most recent undone operation (restore the last character removed by UNDO).
string read() - Return the current content of the document as a string.

There will be a sequence of q queries arr[] on the document. The queries are represented in numeric form:
1 x - Call append(x)
2 - Call undo()
3 - Call redo()
4 - Call read()

The driver code will process the queries, call the corresponding functions, and finally print the outputs of all READ() operations.
You only need to implement the above four functions.

Code :
class Solution {
    Stack<Character> mainStack = new Stack<>();
    Stack<Character> redoStack = new Stack<>();

    public void append(char x) {
        mainStack.push(x);
        redoStack.clear();
    }

    public void undo() {
        if (!mainStack.isEmpty()) {
            redoStack.push(mainStack.pop());
        }
    }

    public void redo() {
        if (!redoStack.isEmpty()) {
            mainStack.push(redoStack.pop());
        }
    }

    public String read() {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : mainStack) {
            sb.append(c);
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

Intuition :
The document changes only through append operations.
Undo and redo operations are simply about reverting or reapplying these append actions in order.

This behavior maps perfectly to the use of two stacks:
One stack to store the current document state.
Another stack to store undone operations so they can be reapplied later.

Whenever a new append happens, all previously undone operations become invalid, so the redo history must be cleared.
________________________________________________________

Approach :
Maintain:
mainStack → stores characters currently present in the document.
redoStack → stores characters removed by undo operations.

append(x):
Push x onto mainStack.
Clear redoStack (redo history is invalid after a new append).

undo():
If mainStack is not empty:
Pop the top character from mainStack.
Push it onto redoStack.

redo():
If redoStack is not empty:
Pop the top character from redoStack.
Push it back onto mainStack.

read():
Convert the contents of mainStack into a string in insertion order and return it.
