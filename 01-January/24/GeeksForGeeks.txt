Josephus problem
You are playing a game with n people standing in a circle, numbered from 1 to n. Starting from person 1, every kth person is eliminated in a circular fashion. The process continues until only one person remains.
Given integers n and k, return the position (1-based index) of the person who will survive.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int josephus(int n, int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            ans = (ans + k) % i;
        }
        return ans + 1;
    }
}

Intuition :
The Josephus problem is about systematic elimination in a circle.
After every elimination, the circle becomes smaller, but the relative positions of the remaining people stay the same, just shifted.

Instead of simulating the entire process (which is inefficient), we observe a pattern:
If we know the survivor position for n-1 people, we can derive it for n people.
When one person is eliminated, the next counting starts from the next position, which causes a shift in indices.

This leads to a recursive / iterative mathematical relation.

Approach :
Use the classic Josephus recurrence:
Let f(n, k) be the survivor’s position using 0-based indexing.

Base case: f(1, k) = 0
Recurrence relation: f(n, k) = (f(n - 1, k) + k) % n

Steps:
Start with ans = 0 (for 1 person).
Iteratively apply the recurrence from 2 to n.
Convert the final result from 0-based to 1-based indexing by adding 1.
This avoids simulation and runs efficiently.
