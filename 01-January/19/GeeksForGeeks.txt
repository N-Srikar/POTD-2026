Remove K Digits
Given a non-negative integer s represented as a string and an integer k, remove exactly k digits from the string so that the resulting number is the smallest possible, while maintaining the relative order of the remaining digits.

Note : The resulting number must not contain any leading zeros.
If the resulting number is an empty string after the removal, return "0".

Code :
class Solution {
    public String removeKdig(String s, int k) {
        Stack<Character> st = new Stack<>();

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            while (!st.isEmpty() && k > 0 && st.peek() > c) {
                st.pop();
                k--;
            }
            st.push(c);
        }

        while (k > 0 && !st.isEmpty()) {
            st.pop();
            k--;
        }

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (!st.isEmpty()) {
            sb.append(st.pop());
        }
        sb.reverse();

        int i = 0;
        while (i < sb.length() && sb.charAt(i) == '0') i++;

        String res = sb.substring(i);
        return res.length() == 0 ? "0" : res;
    }
}

Intuition :
To make the number as small as possible after removing exactly k digits, we want smaller digits to appear as early as possible.
If a digit is larger than the digit that comes after it, keeping the larger digit will increase the value of the number.

This naturally suggests a monotonic increasing stack:
Remove a digit if a smaller digit appears to its right and we still have removals left.
This greedy removal ensures the leftmost digits are minimized first, which has the greatest impact on the final number.

Leading zeros must be avoided, and if all digits are removed, the answer should be "0".

Approach :
Use a stack to build the smallest possible number.
Traverse each digit in the string:
While:
the stack is not empty,
k > 0,
and the top of the stack is greater than the current digit,
pop the stack (remove that digit) and decrement k.
Push the current digit onto the stack.

If k is still greater than 0 after traversal:
Remove the last k digits from the stack.

Build the result string from the stack.
Remove leading zeros from the result.
If the result becomes empty, return "0".
