Stream First Non-repeating
Given a string s consisting of only lowercase alphabets, for each index i in the string (0 ≤ i < n), find the first non-repeating character in the prefix s[0..i]. If no such character exists, use '#'.

Code :
class Solution {
    public String firstNonRepeating(String s) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        Queue<Character> q = new ArrayDeque<>();
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
            q.offer(c);

            while (!q.isEmpty() && freq[q.peek() - 'a'] > 1) {
                q.poll();
            }

            if (q.isEmpty()) sb.append('#');
            else sb.append(q.peek());
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }
}

Intuition :
As we process the string character by character, we need to determine the first character in the current prefix that appears exactly once.
A character that appears more than once is no longer eligible.

This is a classic stream processing problem:
Frequencies must be tracked dynamically.
Order of arrival must be preserved.

To achieve this efficiently, we use:
A frequency array to track how many times each character appears.
A queue to maintain the order of characters that are candidates for being non-repeating.

Approach :
Initialize:
A frequency array freq[26] for lowercase letters.
A queue to store characters as they appear.
A StringBuilder to build the result.

Traverse the string one character at a time:
Increment the frequency of the current character.
Add the character to the queue.

While the queue is not empty and the front character has frequency greater than 1:
Remove it from the queue.

If the queue is empty:
Append '#' to the result.
Otherwise, append the front character of the queue.

After processing all characters, return the built string.
