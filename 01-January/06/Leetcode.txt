1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree
Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on.
Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

Code :
class Solution {
    public int maxLevelSum(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);

        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int maxLevel = 1;
        int currentLevel = 1;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelSize = queue.size();
            int levelSum = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                TreeNode node = queue.poll();
                levelSum += node.val;

                if (node.left != null) queue.offer(node.left);
                if (node.right != null) queue.offer(node.right);
            }

            if (levelSum > maxSum) {
                maxSum = levelSum;
                maxLevel = currentLevel;
            }

            currentLevel++;
        }

        return maxLevel;
    }
}

Intuition :
To find the level of a binary tree with the maximum sum, we need to evaluate the sum of node values level by level. Since trees are naturally explored level-wise using Breadth-First Search (BFS), BFS is the most appropriate traversal technique here. By computing the sum at each level during BFS, we can track which level yields the highest total.

Approach :
Use a queue to perform BFS starting from the root.

Initialize:
maxSum to store the maximum level sum encountered so far.
answerLevel to store the level corresponding to maxSum.
currentLevel starting from 1.

While the queue is not empty:
Get the number of nodes at the current level (size of the queue).
Initialize levelSum = 0.

Dequeue all nodes of this level:
Add their values to levelSum.
Enqueue their left and right children if they exist.
If levelSum > maxSum, update maxSum and answerLevel.
Increment currentLevel.

After traversal completes, return answerLevel.
